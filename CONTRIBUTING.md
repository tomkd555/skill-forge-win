- **SKILL.md files**: Under 500 lines, valid YAML frontmatter, kebab-case naming
- **Python scripts**: Docstrings, type hints, argparse CLI, JSON output, stdlib only
- **Reference files**: Focused on one topic, under 200 lines, concrete examples
- **Agent definitions**: YAML frontmatter with name + description, body in second person
- **Naming**: kebab-case for directories and skill names, snake_case for Python files
- **Formatting**: Use em dash in titles and headings, not double dash
