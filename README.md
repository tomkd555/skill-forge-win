# Skill Forge — Ultimate Claude Code Skill Creator

![Skill Forge](skill-forge-header.jpeg)

> **Blog:** [Learn how to build Claude Code skills](https://agricidaniel.com/blog/skill-forge-build-claude-code-skills)

Design, scaffold, build, review, evolve, and publish production-grade Claude Code skills following the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io).

## Features

- **Plan** — Analyze use cases, select complexity tier (1-4), design architecture with sub-skill decomposition
- **Build** — Scaffold complete skill file trees with SKILL.md, sub-skills, scripts, references, and agents
- **Review** — Audit any skill with a 0-100 health score across 6 quality categories
- **Evolve** — Fix triggering issues, improve instructions, refine architecture based on feedback
- **Publish** — Package as `.skill` files, generate install scripts, prepare for GitHub distribution
- **Convert** — Port skills to OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity, and Cursor
- **Eval** — Run evaluation pipelines with assertions, grading, and multi-agent execution
- **Benchmark** — Measure performance with variance analysis, multiple trials, and threshold gating

## Installation

### Unix / macOS / WSL

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/skill-forge.git
cd skill-forge
bash install.sh
```

### Uninstall

```bash
bash install.sh --uninstall
```

## Usage

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/skill-forge` | Interactive skill creation wizard |
| `/skill-forge plan <domain>` | Architecture and design planning |
| `/skill-forge build <name>` | Scaffold and build a skill |
| `/skill-forge review <path>` | Audit an existing skill (0-100 score) |
| `/skill-forge evolve <path>` | Improve a skill from feedback |
| `/skill-forge publish <path>` | Package for distribution |
| `/skill-forge eval <path>` | Run eval pipeline to test skill quality |
| `/skill-forge benchmark <path>` | Benchmark skill with variance analysis |
| `/skill-forge convert <path>` | Convert to Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, or Cursor |

### Examples

Create a simple skill:

```
/skill-forge build my-tool
```

Design a complex skill ecosystem:

```
/skill-forge plan "DevOps toolkit for Docker and Kubernetes management"
```

Review an existing skill:

```
/skill-forge review ~/.claude/skills/my-skill
```

Convert a skill for other platforms:

```
/skill-forge convert ~/.claude/skills/my-skill
```

Quick scaffold with the CLI script:

```bash
python skill-forge/scripts/init_skill.py devops-toolkit --tier 3 --sub docker,k8s,monitor
```

## Skill Complexity Tiers

| Tier | Name | Structure | Best For |
|------|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Minimal | Single SKILL.md | Simple workflows, document generation |
| 2 | Workflow | SKILL.md + scripts | Tasks needing deterministic validation |
| 3 | Multi-Skill | Orchestrator + sub-skills | Complex domains with multiple workflows |
| 4 | Ecosystem | Full system with agents | Enterprise-grade parallel analysis |
